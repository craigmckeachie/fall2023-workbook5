# Capstone Tips

## Parks Page

1. Load parksArray into parks table.
- Use [lotterytickets](../exercises/lotterytickets/) as an example.
- Could also use PeopleList as an example.

2. Load locationsArray into a select list (dropdown) with Label of State/Territory.

- Use [select list from array](https://github.com/craigmckeachie/fall2023-workbook4/blob/main/demos/3-4-select-list-from-array.html) as example

3. When States list changes filter the parks table by the state.
- Use [tourist bureau workshop](https://github.com/craigmckeachie/fall2023-workbook4/blob/main/workshop/tourist-bureau/activities.html) as an example. The categories in the workshop are the states on the park page. The activities in the workshop are the parks on the parks page ...what is different is parks are loaded into a table whereas your activities were loaded into a dropdown.
